    "text": "The Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS21) is a self-report instrument designed to measure the emotional states of depression, anxiety, and stress. The short-form DASS21 contains 21 items divided evenly across the three subscales. Each item is scored from 0 to 3, and subscale totals are multiplied by 2 to align with the original DASS42 severity classification thresholds.\nThis project provides a brief example of how longitudinal DASS21 data might be visualised for a cohort in a clinical trial context. Specifically, we simulate the effects of an intervention on DASS21 scores over five timepoints: baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. This simulation includes both an intervention and a control group and mirrors REDCap-style data output.\n2 Simulation Logic\nThe dataset used in this analysis was generated using a Python script to simulate individual DASS21 item responses across five timepoints for 20 participants in each group. For the intervention group, an item-level treatment effect was applied to reduce scores by 20% after baseline.\nThe Python script: - Simulates REDCap-style output with Q1–Q21 and total subscale scores - Applies realistic item distributions using weighted probabilities - Aggregates items into DASS subscale scores (Depression, Anxiety, Stress)\nThis simulated dataset was designed to replicate the layout and structure of typical REDCap CSV exports used in clinical trials. Because real participant-level data cannot be shared, this approach enables the visualisation framework to be demonstrated without exposing sensitive information.\nA separate Python script was used to confirm that the simulated intervention and control groups produced discernible differences in mean DASS21 subscale scores across timepoints. The effect size modifier was adjusted iteratively until a realistic, interpretable difference was achieved.\nThis scaffolding could be reused in future studies with real REDCap data, enabling clinicians or trial monitors to track psychological changes across timepoints. The framework is readily extensible to total DASS scores or other patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments such as the PHQ-9 or EQ-5D.\n\n\n\nShow Python Simulation Code\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport os\n\n# Set random seed for reproducibility\nnp.random.seed(42)\n\n# Assigning Parameters\nn_per_group = 20\ntimepoints = [\"baseline\", \"3_months\", \"6_months\", \"9_months\", \"12_months\"]\ngroups = [\"intervention\", \"control\"]\nquestions = [f\"Q{i}\" for i in range(1, 22)]\n\n# Mapping the DASS21 questions to their respective subscales\ndass_anxiety = [\"Q2\", \"Q4\", \"Q7\", \"Q9\", \"Q15\", \"Q19\", \"Q20\"]\ndass_depression = [\"Q3\", \"Q5\", \"Q10\", \"Q13\", \"Q16\", \"Q17\", \"Q21\"]\ndass_stress = [\"Q1\", \"Q6\", \"Q8\", \"Q11\", \"Q12\", \"Q14\", \"Q18\"]\n\n# Creating an effect modifier to apply to the treatment group\ndef apply_treatment_effect(scores, effect_size=0.2):\n    return np.clip(np.round(scores * (1 - effect_size)), 0, 3).astype(int)\n\n# Generate data\ndata = []\n\nfor group in groups:\n    for subject_id in range(1, n_per_group + 1):\n        full_id = f\"{group[:1].upper()}{subject_id:02d}\"\n        for time in timepoints:\n            row = {\n                \"id\": full_id,\n                \"group\": group,\n                \"timepoint\": time\n            }\n            for q in questions:\n                base_score = np.random.choice([0, 1, 2, 3], p=[0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.3])\n                if group == \"intervention\" and time != \"baseline\":\n                    row[q] = apply_treatment_effect(np.array([base_score]))[0]\n                else:\n                    row[q] = base_score\n\n            # Calculate subscale scores\n            row[\"DASS_Anxiety\"] = sum([row[q] for q in dass_anxiety])\n            row[\"DASS_Depression\"] = sum([row[q] for q in dass_depression])\n            row[\"DASS_Stress\"] = sum([row[q] for q in dass_stress])\n            data.append(row)\n\n# Create DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Save to CSV\noutput_dir = \"data\"\nos.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)\ncsv_path = os.path.join(output_dir, \"simulated_dass21_full.csv\")\ndf.to_csv(csv_path, index=False)\n\n\nA separate python script was used to confirm that the simulated intervention and control groups produced discernible differences in mean DASS21 subscale scores across timepoints, the effect size modifier was adjusted until the desired result was achieved.\nThe result is a CSV ready for analysis in R.\nTo visually confirm if the intervention group is meaningfully different to the control group in the simulated data, we quickly inspect the distribution of total DASS21 scores at baseline.\n\n\n\nShow code\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))\n\n# Load data\ndata &lt;- read.csv(here::here(\"data\", \"simulated_dass21_full.csv\"))\n\n# Prepare baseline data\nsummary_plot_data &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  filter(timepoint == \"baseline\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    total_score = DASS_Anxiety + DASS_Depression + DASS_Stress,\n    group = factor(group, levels = c(\"control\", \"intervention\"),\n                  labels = c(\"Control\", \"Intervention\"))\n  )\n\n# Plot\nggplot(summary_plot_data, aes(x = group, y = total_score, fill = group)) +\n  geom_violin(trim = FALSE, alpha = 0.5, show.legend = FALSE) +\n  geom_boxplot(\n    width = 0.1, \n    outlier.shape = NA, \n    fill = \"white\", \n    colour = \"gray40\", \n    linewidth = 0.5\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Control\" = \"#1f77b4\", \"Intervention\" = \"#ff7f0e\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Total DASS21 Scores by Group at Baseline\",\n    subtitle = \"Comparison of control and intervention groups in the simulated data (n = 20 per group)\",\n    x = \"Group\",\n    y = \"Total DASS21 Score (0–126)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 10, color = \"gray30\"),\n    axis.title.x = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 10)\n  )"

    "text": "6 Summary\nThis simulated visualisation demonstrates how individual-level DASS21 data could be presented longitudinally across multiple timepoints. Faceted plots by participant ID provide granular insight into symptom trajectories across depression, anxiety, and stress domains.\nSuch a visualisation could be used in early-phase trials, psychological studies, or pilot data analysis to: - Detect trends in subscale response that may be masked in aggregated DASS21 score - Identify participants with worsening symptoms - Compare intervention vs. control effectiveness visually - Quickly highlight concerning individual patterns (e.g., a participant worsening in depression despite treatment)\nBy allowing clinicians or trial monitors to glance across a cohort and pinpoint which domain is driving deterioration or improvement, this approach provides a clear advantage over reporting only total scores. While this demonstration focuses on DASS21 subscales, the same framework could be adapted to visualise total DASS scores or other common patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments such as the PHQ-9 or EQ-5D.\nFuture enhancements might include summary panels, group-level means, or animated progression across timepoints."
